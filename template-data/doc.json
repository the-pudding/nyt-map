This drove (and to a large extent still drives) daily conversations about what was going down in the world. And the front page was where the most important stuff went. Thanks to the New York Times archive, much of that content is still preserved. I looked at <strong>724,513</strong> section front page headlines since 1900 to find out what countries around the world dominated American attention month after month, year after year."}],"globeHed":"Most mentioned country by year","timelineHed":"Most mentioned country by month","alltimeHed":"Most mentioned countries all-time","method":[{"type":"text","value":"Headlines for every month were collected from the <a href=https://developer.nytimes.com/ target=_blank>New York Times Archive API</a>. They were then filtered down to only entries of type “article” that were a page one (front page or section front) story. The appearance of a country was flagged by looking for the common English country name, commonly used acronym, demonym, large cities, previously used country names, and a handful of colloquial references. The country of Jersey was excluded from this analysis because of too many references to New Jersey. Results were manually reviewed for false positives, and the scripts were re-run to see if a new top country emerged. Due to an issue with the API, there is no data available for 1964, and Sep and Oct of 1978."}]}
