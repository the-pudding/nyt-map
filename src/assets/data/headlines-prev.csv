The Fed has bought huge amounts of Treasury securities in past crises, but the agreement appears to be its first effort to guard against a possible crisis. SQN##369071##THE STANDOFF OVER BEEF Cattle ranchers and feedlot operators are mired in one of their worst slumps ever while meatpackers are earning what analysts estimate are record profits. Although cattle producers and meatpackers agree that ranchers have too many cattle to sell, some producers and agribusiness critics are questioning whether more than simple market forces are at work with regard to the meatpackers' big profits. SQN##364878##PRIVATIZING IN HUNGARY: A DOOR REOPENS Over the last year it has been hard lately to take privatization in Hungary seriously. But now global players in oil and gas, electricity and telecommunications are convinced that the country is at last getting serious about privatizing its largest companies; for Hungary has put up for sale the crown jewels -- its oil company, its electricity- and gas-distribution industry, its major banks and a second stock installment in the state telephone company, Matav. SQN##365092##INTEL'S PROFIT MEASURES UP ON WALL ST. The Intel Corporation rewarded the faithful yesterday with a 41.3 percent rise in third-quarter earnings, meeting or exceeding most analysts' estimates. The news of Intel's profit, combined with the report of inordinate earnings at Sun Microsystems Inc., could set the stage today for a renewed technology stock rally.  SQN##364401##TJX WILL BUY MARSHALLS CHAIN FROM MELVILLE  The Melville Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its faltering Marshalls division to the TJX Companies for $550 million in cash and stock. The deal, analysts said, would provide some needed consolidation in the fiercely competitive discount clothing business. BUSINESS DIGEST SQN##369330##SENATE REPUBLICANS MODIFY PLAN FOR COMPANIES TO TAP PENSION FUNDS Senate Republicans moved to limit the increase in money that companies could take out of their pension plans.
